                <h2>What is a carbon footprint ? </h2>
                <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. <br>

                    <br>
                    The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050. <br>    
                    <br>     
                    Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
